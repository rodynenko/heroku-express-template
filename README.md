# heroku-express-template
Simple static site's template for Heroku, based on ExpressJS

# How To
Copy all your files into `/public` directory:  
* `.html`-files directly
* other files (like `.css`, `.js`, images, etc.) into `/assets` dir (do not forget to configurate correct access in `.html`-files)

Thatâ€™s it. Now you can push your repo into Heroku or other similar services
